deemed helpful.

This project was made for fun and to test out the process of creating a Discord bot. Another 
interesting challenge could be integrating AWS Lex to create a chatbot for Discord DMs but that's a 
project for an other person or an other time.

# kanto-discord
A repository for creating a simple Discord bot.
> Below a few possible features are listed, they will be checked in when completed and marked 
(In progress) when started.
- [ ] (In progress) Bot can come online
- [ ] Answers Hello, How are you, Goodbye and such
- [ ] Creates lists (numeric or bullet) on command
    - [ ] Creates lists with chosen characters or emojis as bullets

- [ ] Creates polls which have a set end time which are voted on through reactions
    - [ ] Replies with result at the set end time
- [ ] Creates master messages which can be changed by a set role
    - [ ] Messages can be set to need approval by reactions by role

## Description of functions
### Basic
> Stuff like API communications
### Snippets
> "Pipe" functions that do simple calculation, re-formatting or conversion
### Bigger features
> Explanation of features

## Technical information
### Code style
> Notes on what the code submitted to the kanto-discord project should look like.

Simplicity to write code is in focus, so either libraries to connect between APIs or own files with 
functions to connect with
APIs should be created. Same goes for often used variables and functions.

Performance should not need to be in focus at all during this project as nothing in it should be 
resource heavy, if something seems that way it is likely it is just done in the wrong way.

As goes for coding tabs are four spaces long, it is best if lines do not exceed 100 columns, 
otherwise language decides the style.

### Dependencies
> List of dependencies
- Github is used to store code
- Heroku is used to deploy bot, and store production config variables
- discord.js is the library used to interact with Discord API

### Dev notes
> Other notes from me that might come up during development, publicly available, but mostly for 
my own sake.
